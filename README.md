[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/easy_isolate.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/easy_isolate)

An abstraction of the Isolate to make it easier to use without losing the control of it's capabilities.

### How it works

A worker is responsible for 1 new thread (isolate).

*** WIP ***

###  Example

The example project is a simulation of a file downloader using a separated thread for each download. It will help you to 
understand how it works in practice. See the code [here](example/lib/main.dart).
